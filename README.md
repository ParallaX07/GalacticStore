#Galactic Goods: An intergalactic e-commerce store

The program will serve as a terminal which links adjacent galaxies with identical terminals by using same interstellar waveform frequencies to allow for trading of rare and unique minerals throughout the Universe. 

1. Requirements gathering:
Users can browse minerals which are categorized by planets of each galaxy that has adopted the use of Galactic Goods. Stock is synchronized throughout all terminals.
Local currencies need to be converted to tokens. 
Consider a search functionality for products, a sort and filter option for product listings, and user profile management (e.g., updating personal information, viewing order history).
Determine any constraints such as the maximum number of items in the cart or specific rules for user registration (password strength, email validation, etc.).

2. Design the classes and their relationships
Consider using interfaces and abstract classes to better organize and structure your code.
Implement exception handling to handle any errors gracefully and ensure the program's robustness.
Implement a class that initializes all the products.

3. Implement the classes: 
Utilize Java's built-in libraries and classes where appropriate (e.g., LocalDate, List, arrayList). 

4. Implement the user interface (text-based): 
Make the menu-driven interface as user-friendly as possible, using clear instructions and prompts.
Validate user input to prevent errors and ensure the application behaves as expected.
Implement a simple help system to guide users on how to use the application.
